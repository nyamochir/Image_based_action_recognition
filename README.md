# YPolaris_action_recognition_CNN
Get real time or video to process the what is happening on the action--> there are several models with with 4classes 8classes and 13classes, also 40 action classes which is original dataset


Lots of things to do:
1. more data -->
  a. Augmentation
  b. pre-processing each training image to be fit appropriotaly to the model.
2. define little more classes
3. Needed computer with HIGH GPU --> solved
5. There are lots of hopes that this would work better --> Better image action classification method is the most important thing
6. LSTM and RNN add --> import


1. what to do next --> data collection and augmentation
2. study and research more about model tuning also, try more about for the better results.
