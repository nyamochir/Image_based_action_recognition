Get real time or video to process the what is happening on the action--> there are several models with with 4out 6out and 8outs also 40 action outs


Lots of things to do:
1. more data --> each category at least 20000K
  a. Augmentation
2. define little more classes
3. Needed computer with HIGH GPU --> my kaggle Limit is reaching only 40hrs in week plus lots of freezing
5. there are lots of hopes that this would work better
6. LSTM and RNN add --> import


1. what to do next --> data collection
2. learn more about what to do ...
